1. Implement Na√Øve Bayes method using scikit-learn library

    Use dataset available with name glass

    Use train_test_split to create training and testing part

    Evaluate the model on test part using score and

         classification_report(y_true, y_pred)

2. Implement linear SVM method using scikit library

    Use the same dataset above

    Use train_test_split to create training and testing part

    Evaluate the model on test part using score and

         classification_report(y_true, y_pred)

   Which algorithm you got better accuracy? Can you justify why?

    By comparing both methods accuracy, linear SVM algorithm got more accuracy than the Naive Bayes algorithm. The algorithm performance is determined based on the specific dataset. Evaluated by their performance using appropriate matrics such as accuracy, precicion, recall and F1-score.These matrics helped to access the models ability to correctly classify instance freom different classes and handle class imbalances.
