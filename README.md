1. Implement Na√Øve Bayes method using scikit-learn library

    Use dataset available with name glass

    Use train_test_split to create training and testing part

    Evaluate the model on test part using score and

         classification_report(y_true, y_pred)

2. Implement linear SVM method using scikit library

    Use the same dataset above

    Use train_test_split to create training and testing part

    Evaluate the model on test part using score and

         classification_report(y_true, y_pred)

   Which algorithm you got better accuracy? Can you justify why?
